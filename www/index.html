				<h2>Our Programs</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>Phoenix Program</h3>
					<p>Private rooms in a comfortable, home-like environment will allow withdrawing babies and their mothers to remain together. Mom is supervised, supported and educated as she cares for her baby through his withdrawal and continues with her own chemical dependency treatment while living at Maddie’s Place.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Nursery</h3>
					<p>When mom is not able to room-in, our carefully designed nursery will provide 24/7 secure, evidence-based, nurturing care for newborns suffering from withdrawal. And their mothers will be supported and encouraged to be the primary caregiver during the day.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Follow-up Care</h3>
					<p>Through partnerships with local pediatric therapy groups, every baby discharged from Maddie’s Place will be provided with Occupational, Physical, Speech and Feeding Therapy as needed over the first year.</p>
				</article>

				<h2>Why We Do It</h2>
				<article>
					<p>Infants born with prenatal exposure to opioids experience symptoms of withdrawal, or Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). These babies are frequently admitted to hospital nurseries, while their mothers are discharged feeling judged, guilty and hopeless. Current research shows that mom is the “best medicine” for NAS babies, and that long term outcomes improve for both of them if they are kept together in the postpartum period. In addition, skilled, individualized care provided in a low-stimulus environment reduces the length of stay, the need for additional narcotic exposure and the cost of treatment for these babies by nearly 75%.</p>
