demark record dns may have an issue.
No issues with specif providers, should work with Heroku

DNS is digital ocean, may need to change the DNS there if working to change it

Currently, the DNS is not pointed to anything specific, so the website is down. Should be pretty easy to repoint once the hosting is figured out.
